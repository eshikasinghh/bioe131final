# **Influenza Virus Protein Pairwise Alignment Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project examines the pairwise alignments of four key influenza virus proteins—**PB1**, **PB2**, **NA**, and **HA**—over three years (**2018**, **2021**, and **2022/2023**) to investigate their evolutionary patterns and conservation.

---

## **Contents**
- **Pairwise alignment data** for PB1, PB2, NA, and HA proteins.
- **Analysis of conservation and variability** for each protein.
- **Identification of key mutations** and structural changes.
- **Implications for viral fitness and vaccine development.**

---

## **Key Findings**
1. **PB1** and **PB2** exhibit high conservation, with minimal changes observed.
2. **NA** shows the highest variability among the four proteins.
3. **HA** balances conservation with adaptation, reflecting evolutionary pressure.
4. Specific **mutations, insertions, and deletions** were identified in all proteins, with implications for function and evolution.

---

## **Usage**
This analysis provides insights for:
- **Understanding influenza virus evolution** over time.
- Identifying potential targets for **antiviral drugs** and **vaccines**.
- Tracking changes in viral proteins that may affect **virulence** or **transmissibility**.

---

## **Additional Notes**
- Consider using **tables** to organize key mutations or alignment results.
- Incorporate **figures or plots** for visualizing variability or conservation trends.
- Add a **References** section for any sources used.
