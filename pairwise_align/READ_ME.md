Influenza Virus Protein Pairwise Alignment Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes pairwise alignments of four key influenza virus proteins (PB1, PB2, NA, and HA) across three years (2018, 2021, and 2022/2023) to study their evolution and conservation patterns.
Contents
Pairwise alignment data for PB1, PB2, NA, and HA proteins
Analysis of conservation and variability for each protein
Identification of key mutations and structural changes
Implications for viral fitness and vaccine development
Key Findings
PB1 and PB2 show high conservation with few changes
NA exhibits the most variability among the four proteins
HA demonstrates a balance between conservation and adaptation
Specific mutations and insertions/deletions identified in each protein
Usage
This analysis can be used to:
Understand influenza virus evolution over time
Identify potential targets for antiviral drugs and vaccines
Track changes in viral proteins that may affect virulence or transmissibility
