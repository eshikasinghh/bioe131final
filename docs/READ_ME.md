This directory was created for this portion of the rubric: 
"A working example of the database, installed in a web-visible location, to which you will also provide a link. One way to manage this is with GitHub Pages
Links to an external site. Alternatively, if you have a computer connected to the Internet with a static IP address, you can use that."

Our working link is located on the READ_ME.md of the main directory.
