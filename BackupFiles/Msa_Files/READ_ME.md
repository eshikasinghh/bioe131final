To visualize MSA (multiple-sequence alignment), go to the "BackupFiles" Folder and click on "Msa_Files". Download the four .fasta files. Go back to the JBrowse, click "File" on the top left corner, "New Session", and launch the "MsaView". Under "MSA file or URL", click on "File", and upload the .fasta file for whichever protein you'd like to see alignments for over the 3 years. Click "Open" and you will see our alignments!
