As part of our project, we analyzed the neuraminidase (NA) gene of the influenza virus to understand how different regions evolve under selective pressures. This analysis provides insights into the virus’s adaptability, the need for annual flu vaccines, and how antiviral resistance develops.

Our Process:

GenBank Analysis: We extracted the NA gene sequence from GenBank data and focused on three functional regions: the Catalytic Domain, essential for viral replication and spread; the Binding Site, targeted by antiviral drugs; and the Epitope Region, recognized by antibodies.

Mutation Identification: By aligning the 2022 NA sequence with a 2018 reference, we identified mutations, including synonymous, non-synonymous, and indels. These mutations were categorized by type and mapped to their respective functional regions.

dN/dS Ratio Calculation: We counted non-synonymous mutations (dN) and synonymous mutations (dS) in each region and calculated dN/dS ratios to measure evolutionary pressures. High dN/dS ratios (>1) indicate positive selection, favoring mutations that enhance adaptation, while low dN/dS ratios (<1) signify purifying selection, preserving essential functions.

This systematic process is a critical component of our project, which examines influenza evolution across key proteins. It highlights NA’s role in immune evasion and drug resistance, providing actionable insights for vaccine and therapeutic design.



This process was a part of our broader project, which  shows how influenza evolves across key proteins to help answer why we need flu vaccines every year. We also focused on emphasizing NA’s role in immune evasion and drug resistance.
