GenBank Codon Analysis Process
As part of our project, we focused on analyzing the neuraminidase (NA) gene of the influenza virus to explore how selective pressures drive its evolution. This gene plays a key role in the virus’s ability to evade immune defenses and develop resistance to antiviral treatments, which explains the need for updated flu vaccines each year. Our analysis specifically examined three functional regions of the NA gene: the Catalytic Domain (essential for viral replication), the Binding Site (targeted by antiviral drugs), and the Epitope Region (recognized by the immune system).

Using GenBank data from 2018 and 2022, we identified and compared mutations (synonymous, non-synonymous, and indels) in these regions. By calculating dN/dS ratios, we assessed evolutionary pressures: regions with high dN/dS ratios are under positive selection, adapting to immune and drug challenges, while regions with low dN/dS ratios remain conserved.


Our Process:

GenBank Analysis: We extracted the NA gene sequence from GenBank data and focused on three functional regions:

Catalytic Domain: Essential for viral replication and spread.
Binding Site: Targeted by antiviral drugs.
Epitope Region: Recognized by antibodies.
Mutation Identification: By aligning the 2022 NA sequence with a 2018 reference, we identified mutations (synonymous, non-synonymous, and indels). These mutations were categorized and mapped to their respective functional regions.

dN/dS Ratio Calculation:

Counted non-synonymous mutations (dN) and synonymous mutations (dS) in each region.
Calculated dN/dS ratios to measure evolutionary pressures:
High dN/dS (>1): Indicates positive selection, favoring mutations that help the virus adapt.
Low dN/dS (<1): Indicates purifying selection, conserving essential functions.

This process was a key component of our broader project, which examines how influenza evolves across key proteins to help answer why we need flu vaccines every year. We also focused on emphasizing NA’s role in immune evasion and drug resistance. By targeting conserved regions while accounting for adaptive changes, this analysis contributes to strategies for more effective vaccine and therapeutic development.
