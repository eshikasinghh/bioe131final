Genbank Codon Analysis Process: 

We analyzed the neuraminidase (NA) gene of the influenza virus to understand how specific regions evolve under selective pressures, which impact vaccine and drug development and help us  understand why we need vaccines every year.  Rhie  primarily looks at the evolutionary pressures within the NA gene for a single year (e.g., 2022 (2018) or 2023 (2022)) and analyzes how different functional regions of the gene are behaving under selective pressures. This involves comparing regions like the Catalytic Domain, Binding Site, and Epitope Region within that year. 

Our process:

GenBank Analysis: Extracted the NA gene sequence and identified key functional regions:
Catalytic Domain: Essential for viral replication and spread.
Binding Site: Targeted by antiviral drugs.
Epitope Region: Recognized by antibodies.
Mutation Identification:
Aligned the 2023 NA sequence with a reference (2022).
Detected mutations (synonymous, non-synonymous, and indels) by comparing differences between the sequences.
Categorized mutations by type and mapped them to functional regions.
dN/dS Ratio Calculation:
Counted non-synonymous mutations (dN) and synonymous mutations (dS) in each functional region.
Calculated dN/dS ratios to measure evolutionary pressures:
High dN/dS (>1): Positive selection (favoring mutations for adaptation).
Low dN/dS (<1): Purifying selection (conservation of function).
